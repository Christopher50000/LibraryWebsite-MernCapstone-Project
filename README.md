# My Capstone Project From my Internet Software Development Course
The Project is a MERN STACK application that is used for checking out books and checking in books if they are Avaiable as well as being able to add a book to a current list of books on certain pages of the UI. I truly enjoyed learning in this course and will try to make the capstone project better as time progresses.
