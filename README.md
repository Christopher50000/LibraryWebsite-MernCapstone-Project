# My Capstone Project From my Internet Software Development Course
The Project is for checking out books and checking in books as well as being able to add a book to a current list of books on certain pages of the UI This Project uses MERN Stack and I truly enjoyed learning in this course and will try to make the capstone project better as time progresses.
